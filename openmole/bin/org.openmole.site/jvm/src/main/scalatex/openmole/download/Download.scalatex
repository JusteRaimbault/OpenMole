@h2{Try our demo website}

Before downloading OpenMOLE, you might want to get a preview of what you can do with it.
You can try OpenMOLE online using our @aa("demo website", href := shared.link.demo).
Please note that the service is reset every 6 hours, so don't be surprised if your current script suddenly vanishes :-)



@h2{Download OpenMOLE}

To run correctly on your own computer, OpenMOLE requires Java version 8 or above.
Check our @aa("FAQ", href := faq.file) to access your Java version information.

@br

When Java is installed, you just need to download and extract the archive below, and you're done!
OpenMOLE is installed and works out of the box!

@br@br

@linkButton(s"Download ${org.openmole.core.buildinfo.version.value} - ${org.openmole.core.buildinfo.version.name} ", Resource.script.openmole.file, classIs(btn ++ btn_danger))

@br@br

However, if you prefer building the OpenMOLE application from sources you can do so as explained @aa("here", href := buildSources.file).

@br@br

Previous versions of the OpenMOLE application and documentation are available @aa("here", href := shared.link.allOpenMOLE).
The previous version logs are gathered @aa("here", href := DocumentationPages.releaseNotes.file).
Due to a data loss in 2016, only the versions from OpenMOLE 6 are available.



@h2{Run OpenMOLE on Linux}

Once you downloaded OpenMOLE, you can then launch it by executing the @i{openmole} file in the installation directory with the @hl.code("./openmole") command.
It will bring up you web browser and you should see something like this:

@br@br

@img(src := Resource.img.mole.uiScreenshot.file, `class` := "uiScreenshot", center(100))

@br@br

OpenMOLEÂ supports Chrome and Firefox.
If you are using another web browser, you will need to copy paste the OpenMOLE url (something like http://localhost:[port]) in either Chrome or Firefox.
