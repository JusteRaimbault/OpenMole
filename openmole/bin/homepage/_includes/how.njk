        <h2>Do I need OpenMOLE?</h2>
        <div>
        <p>If you have:
           <ul type="disc">
               <li>a program you want to study,</li>
               <li>that can run on the command line,</li>
               <li>for which you can set some inputs,</li>
               <li>and get some output variables or files.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>The answer is YES, OpenMOLE is what you've been waiting for!</b></p>
        <p>All you need to do is:
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>plug your program executable in OpenMOLE (5 minutes),</li>
                <li>use one of the distributed exploration algorithms (5 minutes),</li>
                <li>launch the exploration either on your own computer (10 seconds)</li>
                <li>or on a distributed execution environment with thousands of machines (1 minute).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>To summarize, you can start exploring processes at scale using legacy code and advanced numerical methods in approximately 10 minutes.</p>
